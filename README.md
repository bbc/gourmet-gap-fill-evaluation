# Gap Fill Evaluation Tool

This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 825299. <img src="./docs/images/EU_flag.jpg" width="25px">

This tool was built as part of the [GoURMET Project](https://gourmet-project.eu/) to complete Gap Fill evaluation on machine translation models and is open sourced under GPL v3. Issues should be raised via the GitHub issues. Code changes can be proposed by opening a pull request.

## What is Gap Fill

[Gap Fill Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00315) is a standard evaluation approach used in academic research to assess the quality of translation. This approach differs from automatic evaluation such as [BLEU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU) as the evaluation is carried out by a human rather than an algorithm. The goal of Gap Fill is to evaluate a translation model by asking a human to fill in the gaps in a sentence that has been translated by a human using the machine translation of the same sentence as a guide to what words should go in that sentence.

To complete [Gap Fill Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00315) the user is presented with a series of segments. For each segment there is an original segment in the source language there is also a translation of that segment that has been translated by a human and a translation of that segment that has been translated by a machine translation system.

The evaluator will be presented with the full segment that has been translated by a human and the machine translated segment with gaps in. They will be asked to 'fill in the gaps' in the machine translated segment using the human translated segment as a 'hint'.  The evaluator fills in the gaps and based on how closely their answers match the missing word the quality of the translation model can be assessed.

## Creating Data Sets for the App

TODO: Add link to Mikel's scripts for creating a data set once they have been open sourced.
