# Gap Fill Evaluation Tool

GoURMET project tool. The user is presented with a series of sentences. For each sentence there is an original sentence in the source language there is also a translation of that sentence that has been translated by a human and a translation of that sentence that has been translated by a machine translation system.

The evaluator will be presented with the full sentence that has been translated by a human and the machine translated sentence with gaps in. They will be asked to 'fill in the gaps' in the machine translated sentence using the human translated sentence as a 'hint'.  The evaluator fills in the gaps and based on how closely their answers match the missing word the quality of the translation model can be assessed.

## A note on PRs

Currently this is a single dev project so changes are being made and features are added without going through the standard PR review process. PRs are still being opened as they offer a form of documentation but are being merged without review.

## Infrastructure

The cloudformation templates are generated using [cosmos-troposphere](https://github.com/bbc/cosmos-troposphere). This will need to be installed locally in order to update the cloudformation template. How to install this is covered in the [cosmos-troposphere README](https://github.com/bbc/cosmos-troposphere/blob/master/README.rst). Alternatively run `make venv` from within the `infrastructure` directory to set up an virtual environment and install cosmos-troposphere.

To make changes to the stack. Update the [./infrastructure/src/main.py](./infrastructure/src/main.py) and run `make templates/main.json` from inside the `infrastructure` directory.

### DNS

To make changes to the DNS template. Update the [./infrastructure/src/dns.py](./infrastructure/src/dns.py) and run `make templates/dns.json` from inside the `infrastructure` directory.
